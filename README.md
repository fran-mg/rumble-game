# Rumble!

    <td align="left" valign="top" width="25%">
      <p>Rumble! is a mobile party game application designed for local multiplayer gaming. Built from the ground up for React Native and Expo, the app brings high-energy group dynamics directly to iOS and Android devices without the limitations of a web wrapper. Rumble! combines the core mechanics of popular party games like Heads Up, Catchphrase, and Taboo into a single fluid experience.</p>
      <p>Players can interact natively using device tilt sensors to pass or score, or use large, high-contrast touch buttons. The app is engineered for quick social setups, featuring robust team management, live scoring, and an open content model that allows hosts to customize, merge, or dynamically pull in new word decks on the fly.</p>
      <h3>Core Gameplay & Architecture</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Triple Game-Mode Engine</b>: Play distinct variations including Heads Up (forehead-display with tilt tracking), Catchphrase (fast-paced hot potato), and Taboo (clue-giving with restricted words).</li>
        <li><b>Hardware-Accelerated Interaction</b>: Uses mobile gyroscopes and accelerometers for responsive card flips, alongside a clean, high-contrast UI designed for readability in social settings.</li>
        <li><b>Dynamic Deck Management</b>: Modify existing card sets, hide specific words, add custom text entries, or select and shuffle multiple expansion packs into a single session.</li>
        <li><b>Automated Expansion</b>: Pull downstream pack updates directly via Git repository synchronization or generate localized word categories instantly based on user input.</li>
      </ul>
